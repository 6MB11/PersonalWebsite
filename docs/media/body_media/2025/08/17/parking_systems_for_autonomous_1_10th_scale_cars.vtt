00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.960
Ever feel
claustrophobic in

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.080
a busy parking lot?

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.560
worried you might hit a car while pulling in?

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.560
Well, worry no more.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.280
Allow us to present to you

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.960
our autonomous
parking system

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.800
for one-tenth scale cars.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.240
With automated
parking,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.760
you can relax the
knowledge that

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.200
your car will not
be the cause of

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.080
any accident
while parking.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.720
But how exactly does it
work, you might ask?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.520
When the vehicle's
ready to park,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.080
the parking system is run.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.680
This ZED stereo
camera captures

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.200
a point cloud data of

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.640
the area

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.920
surrounding the front
of the vehicle.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.410
This data is then
filtered by points

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.970
along the ground
plane of the ground,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.770
the color of the
parking space,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.490
and the distance
between the lines

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.010
all in order to get
the center point of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.290
the parking spot and the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.370
slopes from the
parking spot.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.570
This center point of
the parking spot and

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.850
the center point of
vehicle is then used

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.890
alongside two
tangent control

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.090
points that chart a

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.650
cubic bezier curve between

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.530
the points in order to
have the car smoothly

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.730
pull in.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.450
So this is the original point cloud
.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.010
that the camera is seeing.
.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.450
This is it filtered by the plane.
.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.530
And then this is it filtered
.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560
for the colour green.
.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.630
And these are the lines
.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.510
superimposed on top of the parking spot.
.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.750
And then these are the locations
.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.750
of the various centroids of the line.
.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.390
So you can see that there is a line here,
.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.750
there is a line here,
.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.670
and there is a line here.
.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.710
And from the two centroids
.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.910
that we had here and here,
.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.310
you can get a parking spot location at
.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.110
the middle of the two centroids.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.230
The control system works

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.870
using a form of pure
pursuit control.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.310
The system starts
off by turning

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.470
the path into a set of

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.990
points for the
car to follow.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.510
The system then calculates
the angle between

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.350
the current path
and the path that

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.780
must be followed to
reach the next point.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.970
The car then steers to follow

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.450
the path until it

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.250
is close enough to
the next point.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.330
This process
continues until

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.730
the car is parked.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.290
Our system also has

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.770
an obstacle avoidance
mechanism for,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.970
say, a jaywalking pedestrian.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.930
First, the
perception system

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.730
filters away
everything on

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.170
the ground so you can

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.730
separate the obstacles
from the parking lots,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.250
then the car waits

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.370
until the obstacle
moves out of the way.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.970
I said... move
out of the way!

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.650
Better.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.330
Now, we return to the control
system and the car parks.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.490
Wow. Let's see a demo of

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.570
this concept in
motion.
