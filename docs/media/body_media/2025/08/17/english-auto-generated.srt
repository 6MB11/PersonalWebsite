1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,960
Ever feel
claustrophobic in

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,080
a busy parking lot?

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,560
worried you might hit a car while pulling in?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,560
Well, worry no more.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,280
Allow us to present to you

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,960
our autonomous
parking system

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,800
for one-tenth scale cars.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,240
With automated
parking,

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,760
you can relax the
knowledge that

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,200
your car will not
be the cause of

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,080
any accident
while parking.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,720
But how exactly does it
work, you might ask?

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,520
When the vehicle's
ready to park,

14
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,080
the parking system is run.

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,680
This ZED stereo
camera captures

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,200
a point cloud data of

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,640
the area

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,920
surrounding the front
of the vehicle.

19
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,410
This data is then
filtered by points

20
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,970
along the ground
plane of the ground,

21
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,770
the color of the
parking space,

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,490
and the distance
between the lines

23
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,010
all in order to get
the center point of

24
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,290
the parking spot and the

25
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,370
slopes from the
parking spot.

26
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,570
This center point of
the parking spot and

27
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,850
the center point of
vehicle is then used

28
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,890
alongside two
tangent control

29
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,090
points that chart a

30
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,650
cubic bezier curve between

31
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,530
the points in order to
have the car smoothly

32
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,730
pull in.

33
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,450
So this is the original point cloud
.

34
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,010
that the camera is seeing.
.

35
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,450
This is it filtered by the plane.
.

36
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,530
And then this is it filtered
.

37
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,560
for the colour green.
.

38
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,630
And these are the lines
.

39
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,510
superimposed on top of the parking spot.
.

40
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,750
And then these are the locations
.

41
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,750
of the various centroids of the line.
.

42
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,390
So you can see that there is a line here,
.

43
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,750
there is a line here,
.

44
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,670
and there is a line here.
.

45
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,710
And from the two centroids
.

46
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,910
that we had here and here,
.

47
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,310
you can get a parking spot location at
.

48
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,110
the middle of the two centroids.

49
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,230
The control system works

50
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,870
using a form of pure
pursuit control.

51
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,310
The system starts
off by turning

52
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,470
the path into a set of

53
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,990
points for the
car to follow.

54
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,510
The system then calculates
the angle between

55
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,350
the current path
and the path that

56
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,780
must be followed to
reach the next point.

57
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,970
The car then steers to follow

58
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,450
the path until it

59
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,250
is close enough to
the next point.

60
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,330
This process
continues until

61
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,730
the car is parked.

62
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,290
Our system also has

63
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,770
an obstacle avoidance
mechanism for,

64
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,970
say, a jaywalking pedestrian.

65
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,930
First, the
perception system

66
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,730
filters away
everything on

67
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,170
the ground so you can

68
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,730
separate the obstacles
from the parking lots,

69
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,250
then the car waits

70
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,370
until the obstacle
moves out of the way.

71
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,970
I said... move
out of the way!

72
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,650
Better.

73
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,330
Now, we return to the control
system and the car parks.

74
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,490
Wow. Let's see a demo of

75
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,570
this concept in
motion.
